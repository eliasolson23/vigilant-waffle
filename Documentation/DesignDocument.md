# Vigilant-Waffle
## Overview
Vigilant-Waffle is a single-player, 2D side-view physics games for PC.
## Objective
The player must navigate a ball upwards by controlling a platform, in order to reach a goal-hole, while avoiding all other trap-holes.
## Gameplay
The platform is controlled by the player with either analog joysticks or keyboard, and each side of the platform can be manipulated up or down, to roll the ball in the desired direction. If the goal-hole is reached, the player starts from the bottom and must reach a higher, more challenging goal-hole. If the ball falls into a trap-hole, the player must start over. There are more trap-holes the farther up the player goes. 
## Player Character
Even though the player controls the platform, the ball is still considered the player character. This ball could be represented by a spaceship, waffle, ball, etc. This depends on the final theme of the game. The platform could have corresponding representation as well, or it could be invisible.
