We made physical prototype of the ramp and decided it will move along with two underlying doodads kind of like a shelf
we know the shelf will have to eventually be fastened to the doodads otherwise it will slide off. 
No matter our solution to the slide-offproblem,we need to create doodads that move up and down along the player input. 
W and S for left doodad and up and down arrow for right doodad
